           <em>Overflow Afterglow</em> advertising campaign designed with guidance from <a href="https://yelizsecerli.com/" target="_blank"><u>Yeliz Secerli</a></u>. As a group show with 7 young artists of all mediums, I chose a text-based, color-focused approach to avoid highlighting just one artist's work and the emphasize the melding of shared concepts, themes, and colors shared between the artists. Each color in the gradient is one of the seven artists thematic color. The branding and concept was used for printed matter such as subway ads, the museum's kiosk, lightpole banners, New York Times Print Ad, and Artforum Print Ad, as well as digital matter, including a motion graphics version for the New York Times flex video advertising and Google display ads.

           Commissioned by Wendy's Subway as the print component to The Quick and the Dead: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha Edition digital identity I designed in March 2022. In designing this book, I took careful consideration of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's own work as well as the work of the 25 contributors -- the wide range of works provided a set of difficulties and in creating a system for them for all 296 pages, I found much joy and satisfaction. Typefaces are GT Sectra and ABC Favorit. Designed with assistance from <u><a href="https://patrickym.cargo.site/" target="_blank></u>Patrick Yang MacDonald</a>.

          Lead rebrand of NYJFF for the years 2023 and 2024. For the rebrand, I was inspired by the idea of scrolling credits, which includes an option for motion and still image. It also allowed for the variety of film stills that are used in promotion, with both right and left applications. I designed print and digital epehemera for this project including print posters, digital ads, and social media posts, with a motion graphic component.

           I lead the digital side of our annual Purim Ball branding, making animated graphics for our Evites and newletters to be sent to all patrons and members of the museum. These are in conjunction with the overall Purim Ball branding that our team creates each year. 2024 branding follows the theme of Birthday Party - for the Save the Date and After Party, I created illustrations of noisemakers and crowns from the museum's collection. 2023 branding follows the theme of poodles - for the Save the Date, I was inspired by lenticular cards.

                <em>The Quick & The Dead: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha</em> involved a two part design commission for publisher, Wendy's Subway.
              </summary>
              <br>
             For the first half of the project, I created an identity system based off of Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's written and visual work: primarily inspired by her use of fragmentation. This part of the project involved designing a series of five lecture graphics for IG and web, as well as creating another series of graphics for the two commissioned artists attached to the lecture series. One is currently in progress, and for the other, I created a poster gif playing with obscuring and revealing text.

             <br><br>The second half of the project involves designing an end-of-series book that is a culmination of all the lectures and work submitted by participants in the lectures.

                  <em>Recipes for Community</em> is a project sown from a simple concept: sharing recipes to bridge distance.
                </summary>
                <br>
                The book documents an email chain I started in March 2021, connecting 6 people of Asian diaspora living in America, some of whom had met individually but have never come together as a whole. Through the cultural medium of cooking, Recipes for Community seeks to apply the essence of "cooking for one another" as a concept beyond cooking, one that can be applied to any form of connectivity and community. By having the participants share recipes, stories, pictures from their childhoods, and more, Recipes for Community unfolds beyond a "cookbook," transforming into an exploration of space, memory, community, and family, while building exactly that ‚Äî a family.

               <br><br>Ostensibly, this book documents a community started as a space to provide healing for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during a year when the veil of model minority was pulled back to reveal how truly vulnerable we are and have always been to the violence of a perpetually foreign existence. However, I want this project to be a seed to grow more intimate, healing communities across digital and physical boundaries, not only for AAPI, but other marginalized communities as well.
               <br><br>Recipes for Community is both an object and an invitation ‚Äî a way of reminding others the solidity of the communities we create, and an open invitation to join our table.

                <br>
                This zine was created in E Roon Kang's Thesis 1 course, taking three major themes and conducting extensive research on them, highlighting important people and works of art that are related to those concepts. This was an exercise in design research and conception for a year-long design process, culminating in <a href="https://bfacd.parsons.edu/2021/claire-zhang" target="_blank"><u>Recipes for Community</u></a>.

                <br>
                  The project began as an assignment for Lynn Kiang's Experience in Space class. The prompt was to research and design a temporary installation that would interact with a chosen public building. I wanted to create an installation that intervened with museums as an institution, calling for provenence and ultimately, repatriation of stolen art.
                  The Johnson Museum of Art in particular is known for having one of the largest Asian Art collections in all of the United States. Video of on-site installation <a href="https://vimeo.com/570133309" target="_blank"><u>here</u>.</a>

                  <em>The Light Series</em> is a series of 5 projected posters created in Shira Inbar's Motion Graphics class, under the topic of urgency.
                </summary>
                <br>
                I chose to focus on representing the urgency of time passing through the dissolution of light. The motion design was meant to force the viewer to spend time watching, as the text slowly becomes fully revealed throughout the whole loop. Posters were created using Indesign and After Effects, and projected onto the entrance of the Parsons building.
